 🔐 AWS SimuLearn – Core Security Concepts
📖 Overview

Completed the AWS SimuLearn: Core Security Concepts hands-on training (1 hour), focused on implementing secure access controls within a simulated stock exchange environment.

The objective was to design and deploy a solution that restricts support engineers’ access to only the permissions required for their specific roles, following the Principle of Least Privilege.

This assignment was completed inside a live AWS Management Console, where I built and validated the security configuration in a real AWS environment.
