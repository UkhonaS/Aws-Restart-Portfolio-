# AWS SimuLearn – Secure Network Architecture & Traffic Control

# 📜 Certificate Overview

This certificate was earned through an AWS SimuLearn assignment based on a simulated real-world business scenario involving a financial services organization seeking to design a secure, scalable, and highly available AWS network architecture.

The assignment focused on planning, designing, and validating a VPC architecture that ensures secure isolation, controlled internet access, and efficient traffic management using AWS networking best practices.

# 🧠 Scenario Description

The fictional organization required a cloud networking solution that could:

Securely isolate internal workloads from the public internet

Control inbound and outbound traffic

Ensure high availability across multiple Availability Zones

Support scalable application growth while maintaining security

The solution aligned with AWS Well-Architected Framework networking and security principles.

# 🛠️ What I Did
