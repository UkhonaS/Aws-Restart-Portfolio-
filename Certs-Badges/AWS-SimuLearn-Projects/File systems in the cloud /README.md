 # AWS SimuLearn – Centralized File Storage with Amazon EFS
# 📜 Certificate Overview

This certificate was earned through an AWS SimuLearn assignment based on a simulated real-world business scenario involving a pet modeling agency seeking a centralized, scalable, and managed file storage solution.

The assignment focused on designing and implementing a shared file system on AWS that allows multiple branch offices and compute resources to access the same data without maintaining on-premises storage infrastructure.

## 🧠 Scenario Description

The fictional pet modeling agency required a solution that could:

Share files centrally across multiple branch offices

Eliminate physical storage management and maintenance

Scale automatically as data usage grows

Provide reliable and secure access to shared files

The solution needed to leverage AWS managed services to reduce operational overhead while maintaining availability and performance.

# 🛠️ What I Did

Reviewed a real-world inspired business storage scenario

Evaluated different AWS storage options for shared file access

Selected Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) as the optimal solution

Designed a centralized file storage architecture on AWS

Configured Amazon EFS endpoints for multi-instance access

Built and validated the solution using AWS SimuLearn guided labs in a live AWS Management Console

🤖 AWS SimuLearn Experience

This assignment utilized AWS SimuLearn’s generative AI features to simulate realistic customer conversations and problem-solving scenarios.

An AI quiz agent evaluated solution-design decisions

An AI helper agent (Dr. Newton) provided guided assistance when needed

Each design conversation was followed by hands-on implementation in a live AWS environment

This approach reinforced both technical and professional skills, preparing me for real-world cloud roles.
