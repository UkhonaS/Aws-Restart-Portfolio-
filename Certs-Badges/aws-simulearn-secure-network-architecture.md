# 🏦 Secure Network Architecture on AWS (SimuLearn)

**File Name:** aws-simulearn-secure-network-architecture.md  

## 📘 Project Type  
Simulated Business Scenario – AWS SimuLearn

## 📝 Description  
This project is based on a simulated real-world banking scenario where the organization aims to design a secure network architecture that controls communication between internal resources and the public internet. The bank requires a network design that ensures isolation of internal resources while allowing controlled and secure internet access.

Using AWS SimuLearn, I analyzed the business and technical requirements, designed an appropriate AWS-based networking solution, and implemented the architecture in a live AWS Management Console environment through structured, step-by-step lab guidance. This experience reflects how cloud professionals plan, communicate, and deploy secure cloud solutions in enterprise environments.

## 🌐 Scenario Overview  
The fictional bank required:
- Secure isolation of internal network resources  
- Controlled ingress and egress to the internet  
- Proper routing and traffic management  
- A scalable, secure, and best-practice AWS network architecture  

The solution focused on creating a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with carefully planned subnets, routing tables, gateways, and security controls.

## 🛠️ AWS Services Used  
- **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}** – Used to create an isolated virtual network environment, define IP ranges, subnets, route tables, and control traffic flow  
- **:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} (EC2)** – Used to deploy compute resources within the secure VPC network  

## 🎯 Objectives Achieved  
- Analyzed key AWS networking components including VPCs, subnets, internet gateways, and route tables  
- Evaluated the advantages of VPC-based network isolation and segmentation  
- Applied CIDR block notation and IP addressing concepts to design subnets  
- Configured secure VPC traffic routing using gateways, network access control lists (NACLs), and security groups  

## 🧠 Learning Experience  
AWS SimuLearn leverages generative AI to simulate realistic customer interactions, strengthening both technical and communication skills. During this project, AI-generated customers evaluated solution explanations, an AI quiz agent assessed understanding, and an AI helper agent (Dr. Newton) provided guidance when challenges arose.

After each solution design discussion, the proposed architecture was built and validated in a live AWS Console environment, providing hands-on, real-world cloud experience.

## 🚀 Skills Demonstrated  
AWS Networking Fundamentals, Secure Cloud Architecture Design, VPC Traffic Routing and Access Control, CIDR and IP Addressing, Cloud Problem-Solving, and Professional Communication Skills.

## 📂 Repository Purpose  
This file documents my AWS SimuLearn practical experience and demonstrates hands-on capability in designing and implementing secure AWS network architectures suitable for enterprise and financial-sector environments.
