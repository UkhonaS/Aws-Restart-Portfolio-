# Projects

This folder contains practical cloud projects completed as part of my learning journey in the AWS re/Start program.

The projects in this section focus on applying AWS concepts to real-world scenarios by designing, deploying, and documenting cloud-based solutions. Each project demonstrates the ability to plan, implement, and explain cloud infrastructure using AWS services and best practices.

Key skills demonstrated through these projects include:
- Designing basic cloud architectures
- Deploying and configuring AWS services
- Applying security and access control concepts
- Understanding networking and compute integration
- Troubleshooting and validating solutions
- Documenting technical work clearly and professionally

Each project includes a detailed explanation of the problem, the AWS services used, and the outcomes achieved.
