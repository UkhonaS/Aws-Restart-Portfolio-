# Labs

This folder contains hands-on technical labs completed as part of my cloud learning journey.

Each lab documents practical experience with AWS services through real-world scenarios, including configuration, monitoring, security, and resource management.

The labs are organized by domain (e.g. Compute, Networking, Storage) to clearly demonstrate my skills and progression.
