# # Compute Labs

This folder contains hands-on AWS compute labs completed during the AWS re/Start program.

These labs focus on understanding and working with AWS compute services, particularly Amazon EC2. Through practical exercises, I learned how to launch, configure, and manage virtual servers in the cloud.

Key skills demonstrated in this section include:
- Launching and configuring Amazon EC2 instances
- Understanding instance types and pricing models
- Working with key pairs and security groups
- Connecting to EC2 instances using SSH
- Managing instance lifecycle (start, stop, terminate)
- Applying basic troubleshooting techniques

These labs helped build a strong foundation in cloud compute concepts and real-world AWS infrastructure management.
